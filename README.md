Interactive Form 

In this project I will use Javascript regex, validators, conditionals. I will also use HTMP and CSS to make an interactive, engaging user friendly 
web form with the many tools JavaScript provides to ensure the heave lifting happens behind the scenes. This was a challenging, yet fun project that I learned so much about user interface and accessibility like FOCUS. I learned the value as a developer of intentionally designing code that ensures all users have a great experience.
